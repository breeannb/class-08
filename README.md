# Blogpost style Observations for HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” 

> Overall, CSS is such a massive undertaking, but I feel can be so rewarding once you get a pattern of drafting, designing and fine-tuning.  I hope that in the future it will become second nature, and not just an afterthought. I've been very focused in making all the 'gears' work on the website and less on how to make it visually communicating

> In previous design classes, something that always struck me as important in design is User Experience for those that or deaf or have visual impairments.  I always try to think of the intention of a layout and features on those that may need it most. CSS can also play a big part in how easily some elements are accessed. 

> I did also love the difference between fixed layout and liquid. I have always preferred sites with liquid layout, but think aesthetically it does warp and lose control 

> I do want to look up layout grids and best pracrices for designing.  I do love how thorough this book is in regards to the exact dimensions that we should adhere to.
